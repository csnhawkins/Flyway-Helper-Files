# Script Name: 03_Flyway_State_Check.ps1
# Version: 1.0.0
# Author: Chris Hawkins (Redgate Software Ltd)
# Last Updated: 2025-11-25
# Description: Flyway State Based - Use the CHECK verb to create a report detailing all pending changes/detected drift and code analysis
# ===========================

# Variables - Customize these for your environment #
$REPORT_FILENAME = "Flyway-Check-All_Report.html"  # Output deployment script name
$WORKING_DIRECTORY = "C:\WorkingFolders\FWD\State_Based_Projects\MSSQL_State"  # Path to Flyway state-based project root
$SCRIPT_FILENAME = "Flyway_Deployment_Script.sql"  # Output deployment script name
$SOURCE_ENVIRONMENT = "schemaModel"  # Source environment name (desired state)
$TARGET_ENVIRONMENT = "Test"  # Target database environment name
$TARGET_ENVIRONMENT_USERNAME = ""  # Target database username (leave empty for flyway.toml)
$TARGET_ENVIRONMENT_PASSWORD = ""  # Target database password (use env variables in production)

# NOTE: First-time execution warning #
# If this is the first time running check against the target environment, you may receive warnings
# about missing snapshots in the snapshotHistory table. This will be resolved after:
# - Running the 04_Deploy script (which can save snapshots automatically), OR
# - Running the 05_Snapshot script to create an initial snapshot

# Prepare Script for Deployment #
